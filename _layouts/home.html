        I'm a researcher at the Engineering Institute (Instituto de Ingenieria) of UNAM in Mexico City in seismology and in laser-ultrasonic, trying to work as much on the theoretical as the practical aspects. My topics of interest are the modeling of the generation and propagation of mechanical waves through semi-analytical or finite element methods, the recovery of Green functions from ambient noise, and its application to the characterization of the subsoil at several scales (city, geothermal fields, volcanic, earth crust or even crust-mantle boundary) and the non-destructive characterization of materials. More recently, I focus on a newborn seismological method called Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) that uses fiber optic cables as transmisser of information and as sensors, mainly to better assess the seismic hazard in urban areas. I have been teaching classes related to physics and seismic hazards for undergraduate and master levels at the ENES of Morelia and now I teach seismology and elastodynamics for master's students in the Earth Sciences school at UNAM.</p>
